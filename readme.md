# Katawa Crash Decompilation
I found a reddit post asking for the source for this game to be released, while that was 10 years ago I found this game funny enough to warrent my effort for decompiling it. If you are looking to recompile the game please read the requirements section. Otherwise stick to the pre compiled releases. The goal of this project is to fix any bugs that were left unfixed when it was abandoned, while still maintaining most of the game the way it was in 2011. 

Right now the source is really confusing to go through, this isn't the fault of the original developers since comments are (to my knowledge) thrown out during compiliation. While it would've been nice if things were nicely split into different files to make maintability easier, its not really my code to judge since it does (for the most part) function. 

## Requirements

### Flash Editor
The version of the flash editior I used to compile this is quite old. While you may have luck with newer versions, I've stuck with Flash Professional CS6 for compatiblity reasons. Unlike the fonts, I cannot include this software, and I will **not** advise you on how to find it. I would prefer that contributers who are editing the project file use this version as well.

### Fonts
The required fonts are included in the `/Fonts/` folder, please add these to your system. 

## Contributations
Contributations are much appreciated on the project, however do note that you *must* save your project uncompressed to make source control easier. Also since I have up to this point been the only person working on the decompile I have no idea how well even the uncompressed project will work. 

## Credits
Obviously most of the credit here goes to [gainare_tottori](https://ks.fhs.sh/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3071) on the Katawa Shoujo forums. Also major credit to 4LS since most of the characters belong to them. Theres alot of other properties I don't recongize, if somehow something that belongs to you is here and you don't like it please contact me on discord (my username is superboo07) instead of taking down the entire project. Due to most of this project not really belonging to me I do not require credit if you redistribute this project.

## Ruffle Web Emulation

You can emulate and play Katawa Crash in modern browsers using Ruffle (Flash WebAssembly emulator):

1. Start the local Ruffle server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
2. Open `http://localhost:8080` in your web browser.
3. Use the web interface to switch between `Katawa.crash.swf` and `Source Code/_assets/assets.swf`, control playback (pause, restart, fullscreen, quality), and inspect Ruffle ActionScript 3 trace/log output.
